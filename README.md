# DiceStat
A quick stat program used to prove people wrong and keep myself familiar with Python


I was playing Risk with my family and my brother started to roll all of the dice and only took the higher dice to use for a real roll. At first I thought that this would make it worse, because I thought that because the dice had one high roll, it would get a lower one next. I learned that the odds should only be applied each time instead of combined, but for some reason I became skeptical of this. So I decided to make this quick program to see what was correct.

To use this, roll 2 dice. Re-roll the higher die and enter that. Then, re-roll the lower dice and enter that.
This shows:
- If the current roll worked or not
- The overall adverage roll from the higher dice
- The overall adverage roll from the lower dice
- The ratio of times it worked to the times it did not work

So, I was able to prove myself and my brother wrong. Yay
